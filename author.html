                <p>
                    I spent the first half of my childhood in the streets of Manila, 
                    and the other half in the country-side of Burnham & Highbridge. 
                    This dizzying effect on my childhood resulted in my early social 
                    skills to be cryptic at best, and unfathomable at worst. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the desert of anti-social behaviour, I found my silicon oasis: 
                    Minecraft. I was unemployed as a child, so I lived and breathed Minecraft. 
                    I quickly discovered the existence of Redstone: a mimicry of programming. 
                    I unknowingly took my first CS steps, learning how to build from YouTube.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the Redstone Cradle, I built my foundations with Python, drawing with turtles, 
                    making text games, to my first big project: Card Company. A gamified flashcard app.

                <p>
                    My partner is my true north.  She is an ocean away in Vietnam, the long distance 
                    isn't ideal nor can I stay there long term without a stable income. After 
                    graduating from Aberystwyth University, I took the chance to meet her and my 
                    family in the Philippines and Vietnam. Living a simple lie with my partner, 
                    working on projects both physical and digital. It was the life I wanted to live, 
                    but I eventually I had to come back to the UK.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using my background in Computer Science, a solution I came up with was 
                    Web Development. It is a very remote career than enables me to find clients 
                    or employers that will allow this lifestyle I'm working towards.

                <p>
                    I'm a web-dev freelancer that works with small businesses. The websites I make 
                    range from a single page portfolio to a fully e-commerce website. My websites 
                    take around 4-6 weeks of development at most, each week following an iterative 
                    development cycle: Design, Develop, Test, Evaluate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't forget to keep healthy. Through exercise, I cover all physical aspects 
                    in gym throughout the week. For my nutrition, I follow a relaxed set of rules 
                    (protein in each meal, limit junk food, listen to your body). I don't intend to 
                    ever be serious about my diet. I think you lose something important when you forget 
                    to enjoy food.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other things I'm looking into is app development. It's a sector that Web Development 
                    is neighbours with with a lot of skills transferrable to App Development. I'm also 
                    looking into game development for fun. Keeping it light and as a hobby.
