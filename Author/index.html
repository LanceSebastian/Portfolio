                <p>
                    I spent the first half of my childhood in the streets of Manila, 
                    and the other half in the country-side of Somerset. 
                    This dizzying effect on my childhood resulted in my early social 
                    skills to be cryptic at best, and unfathomable at worst. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I didn't have much as a kid, just 3 meals a day, a beautiful home by the beach, 
                    and a loving family. But then, I found Minecraft. It was bliss. I consumed 
                    Minecraft content endlessly, quickly discovering the existence of Redstone: 
                    a mimicry of programming. I unknowingly took my first CS steps, learning how to 
                    build from YouTube.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the Redstone Cradle, I built my foundations with Python, drawing with turtles, 
                    making text games, to my first big project: Card Company. A gamified flashcard app.

                    My partner is my true north.  She is an ocean away in Vietnam, the long distance 
                    isn't ideal nor can I stay there long term without a stable income. After 
                    graduating from Aberystwyth University, I took the chance to meet her and my 
                    family in the Philippines and Vietnam. Living the simple life with my partner, 
                    working on projects both physical and digital. It was the life I was happy to live, 
                    but I eventually I had to come back to the UK.
                </p>

                    Using my background in Computer Science, a solution I came up with was 
                    Web Development. It is a very remote career than enables me to find clients 
                    or employers that will allow this lifestyle I'm working towards.

                <h2 style="text-align: center;">What am I up to?</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a web-dev freelancer that works with small businesses. The websites I make 
                    range from a single page portfolio to a fully e-commerce website. My websites 
                    take around 4-6 weeks of development at most, each week following an iterative 
                    development cycle: Design, Develop, Test, Evaluate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't forget to keep healthy. Through exercise, I cover all physical aspects 
                    in gym throughout the week. For my nutrition, I follow a relaxed set of rules 
                    (protein in each meal, limit junk food, listen to your body). I don't intend to 
                    ever be serious about my diet. I think you lose something important when you forget 
                    to enjoy food.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other things I'm looking into is app development. It's a sector that Web Development 
                    is neighbours with with a lot of skills transferrable to App Development. I'm also 
                    looking into game development for fun. Keeping it light and as a hobby.
